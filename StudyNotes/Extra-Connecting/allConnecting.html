<h2>Connecting to the server through a slow network</h2>
<p>Editing files on the server over a slow network is painful (since most keystrokes involve a trip to the server to tell the program running there, and a trip back to tell your screen to change); so I've found a text editor that runs on *your* machine, but still allows you to open and save files on the server (and that's free and multiplatform :); so I've now written a new writeup (<a href="komodo/connect_komodo.html">Connecting with a slow network</a>). By the way, this also works if you don't like XLiveCD or Putty and XMing.</p>

<p>You may also want to check the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKSUiVjlRPg">Video on accessing the server with Komodo</a>

<h2>Other ways to connect to the server</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="connectingXLiveCD.pdf">Using XliveCD from Home</a> XLiveCD has all you need, you do not install anything on your machine, but only works for Windows XP. You can also check in this <a href="xlivecd_cd_login.swf">Connecting with XliveCD video</a> or, if you're in our labs this <a href="login.htm">Connecting from our labs video</a></li>
	<li>If you're using Windows Vista or 7, you probably want to follow the instructions at <a href="Setting%20up%20Vista%20Home%20Premium%20Remote%20Log%20in%20a%20Linux%20Server%20via%20SSH.pdf">Putty+Xming notes</a> and this <a href="Extra-Connecting/XmingWindows7.swf">Putty+Xming video</a></li>
	<li>A quick way to connect from Windows, but that does NOT allow you to run GUI programs like buefish or mrxvt is just downloading putty as described in <a href="Extra-Connecting/connectingPuttyOnly.pdf">Connecting with putty only</a></li>	
	<li>If you use Linux, you probably have an XWindows server and ssh, so just start from ssh</li>
	<li>If you use Mac OSX, you probably have ssh but may not have XWindows. You can get XWindows from <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosx_updates/x11formacosx.html">X11 for MacOS X</a>, and then open a terminal window and start from ssh ...</li>
</ul>
